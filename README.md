## mathlib

This is a Java library I began writing a while ago.  Its main purpose was to
provide a common implementation for Mandelbrot-style fractal rendering and
imaging.

The code is largely uncommented and is likely of limited to use to anyone at
this point.  However, I remember being pleased with some of this code (and
less pleased with other bits) and thought it was lost several hard drives ago.
So, I'm putting it here mostly to keep it safe in the event I find myself
working with Java again, or want to port some of the work to another language.
